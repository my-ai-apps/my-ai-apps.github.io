Quiz: Understanding Chemical Reactions and Stoichiometry
Question 1: What is a chemical reaction, and how does it differ from a physical change?
Answer: A chemical reaction is a process in which substances (reactants) undergo a transformation to form new substances (products) with different chemical properties. It differs from a physical change because a physical change only alters the form or appearance of a substance without changing its chemical composition.

Question 2: What are reactants and products in a chemical reaction?
Answer: Reactants are the starting substances that undergo a chemical change, while products are the new substances formed as a result of the reaction.

Question 3: What is the Law of Conservation of Mass, and why is it important in chemical reactions?
Answer: The Law of Conservation of Mass states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. It is important because it ensures that the total mass of reactants equals the total mass of products, allowing us to balance chemical equations accurately.

Question 4: How do you balance a chemical equation?
Answer: To balance a chemical equation, adjust the coefficients (the numbers in front of chemical formulas) so that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation, ensuring the conservation of mass.

Question 5: Why can’t subscripts in chemical formulas be changed when balancing equations?
Answer: Changing subscripts alters the identity of the compound, which would mean a different substance is being formed. Instead, coefficients are adjusted to maintain the correct proportions of elements.

Question 6: What is a mole in chemistry, and why is it useful?
Answer: A mole is a unit that represents 6.022 × 10²³ particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) of a substance. It is useful because it allows chemists to count atoms and molecules in measurable amounts for chemical reactions.

Question 7: What is molar mass, and how is it calculated?
Answer: Molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance, expressed in grams per mole (g/mol). It is calculated by summing the atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule or formula unit.

Question 8: How do you convert grams of a substance to moles?
Answer: To convert grams to moles, divide the mass of the substance by its molar mass:
moles = mass (g)/molar mass (g/mol)
 
Question 9: What is a limiting reactant in a chemical reaction?
Answer: The limiting reactant is the substance that is completely consumed first in a chemical reaction, determining the maximum amount of product that can be formed.

Question 10: How can you determine the limiting reactant in a reaction?
Answer: Convert the given amounts of reactants to moles, use the reaction's stoichiometry to determine which reactant produces the least amount of product, and identify that reactant as the limiting reactant.

Question 11: What happens when a reaction has an excess reactant?
Answer: The excess reactant is not completely consumed and remains after the reaction has reached completion.

Question 12: What is percent yield, and how is it calculated?
Answer: Percent yield measures the efficiency of a chemical reaction. It is calculated using the formula:
Percent Yield = ( actual yield / theoretical yield) × 100

Question 13: What are the five main types of chemical reactions?
Answer: The five main types of chemical reactions are synthesis, decomposition, single replacement, double replacement, and combustion.

Question 14: What is a synthesis reaction? Provide an example.
Answer: A synthesis reaction occurs when two or more substances combine to form a single product. Example:
2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O

Question 15: What is a decomposition reaction? Provide an example.
Answer: A decomposition reaction occurs when a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances. Example:
CaCO3 -> CaO + CO2
 
Question 16: What is a single replacement reaction? Provide an example.
Answer: A single replacement reaction occurs when one element replaces another in a compound. Example:
Zn + 2HCl -> ZnCl2 + H2

Question 17: What is a double replacement reaction? Provide an example.
Answer: A double replacement reaction occurs when ions in two compounds exchange places to form new compounds. Example:
Na2SO4 + BaCl2 -> 2NaCl + BaSO4

Question 18: What is a combustion reaction? Provide an example.
Answer: A combustion reaction occurs when a substance reacts with oxygen, often producing heat and light. Example:
CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O

Question 19: What are endothermic and exothermic reactions?
Answer: Endothermic reactions absorb heat energy, while exothermic reactions release heat energy.

Question 20: How does temperature affect reaction rates?
Answer: Increasing temperature increases reaction rates by providing more kinetic energy to reactant molecules, increasing collision frequency and effectiveness.

Question 21: How does concentration affect reaction rates?
Answer: Higher concentration increases reaction rates because more reactant particles are present, leading to more frequent collisions.

Question 22: How does surface area affect reaction rates?
Answer: Greater surface area increases reaction rates by exposing more reactant particles to collisions.

Question 23: What is a catalyst, and how does it work?
Answer: A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a reaction without being consumed, lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction to occur.

Question 24: What is an equilibrium reaction?
Answer: An equilibrium reaction occurs when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, meaning the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant over time.

Question 25: What is Le Chatelier’s Principle?
Answer: Le Chatelier’s Principle states that if a system at equilibrium is disturbed, it will shift to counteract the disturbance and restore equilibrium.

Question 26: How does adding a reactant affect equilibrium?
Answer: Adding a reactant shifts the equilibrium toward the products to reduce the added substance.

Question 27: What is the difference between strong and weak acids?
Answer: Strong acids completely ionize in solution, while weak acids only partially ionize.

Question 28: What is the pH scale, and what does it measure?
Answer: The pH scale measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in a solution, determining acidity or basicity (0-14 scale).

Question 29: What is the role of stoichiometry in real-world applications?
Answer: Stoichiometry helps in manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and environmental science by ensuring correct reactant-product ratios for efficiency and safety.

Question 30: Why is understanding chemical reactions important in everyday life?
Answer: Chemical reactions are essential for processes like digestion, energy production, medicine, and industrial manufacturing, affecting everything from food to technology.
